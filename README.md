# Hello-World
July 20th getting starting with GitHub test.
A little information about myself:
  I am Jorge Luis Reina Jara, I live in Bogota, 
	Colombia, I speak Spanish but also a little
	bit of English and I am an engineering student,
	that's why I'm trying to get how to Git properly.


And now, another change over here.
